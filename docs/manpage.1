This program uses utilities by The FFmpeg developers, the Independent JPEG Group, the FSF, Steveice10, dnasdw, profi200 and Rinnegatamante\. With the exception of Rinnegatamante\'s jpgv converter, of which the source is included and compiled at runtime, no utilities are included in the source code\.

The jpgv converter does not have any license attached to it, but the repository the original converter is in is under the GPL v3\.0, so I\'m assuming the jpgv converter is under the GPL v3\.0 as well\.

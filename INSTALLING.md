## Installing

The following packages are needed to be added to your PATH for vcc-linux to function:

- `ffmpeg`: Available through your package manager.
- `jpegtran`: Available through `libjpeg-turbo-progs` on Ubuntu systems. Can also be manually compiled as part of [libjpeg](http://www.ijg.org/)
- `libstdc++6`: This is usually installed by default, but you may require a newer version.
- `3dstool`: Can be obtained [here](https://github.com/dnasdw/3dstool/releases)
- `bannertool`: Can be obtained [here](https://github.com/Steveice10/bannertool/releases)
- `makerom`: Can be obtained [here](https://github.com/profi200/Project_CTR/releases)

Additionally, the GCC compiler is needed. This is normally installed by default on most systems, and is otherwise installed as a dependency of libstdc++6.

For updating the documentation (available in the docs folder), [`ronn`](https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/) is required. You can install ronn by running `gem install ronn` (requires Ruby).

NOTE:
- Run `build.sh` in the `linuxstuffs/vid2jpgvsauce` folder first to compile the jpgv encoder.
